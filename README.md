# SBIOSA is a program that uses 'spaced repetition', a method of practising at optimally timed intervals, in order to maximise the rate of learning a skill. 'Setup' allows the user to set up some skills that SBIOSA can recognise in order that they can be logged and practised. 'Learn' allows the user to rate their performance of the skill, and shows the user what skills they should practice on the day that the program has been run.
